# ComicFinder

This app lets you find comic books by searching for your favorite hero.
After selecting a comic book from the search results, you can view more details about that book, and place the comic book on your desk using AR.

My main focus for this project was using SwiftUI and ARKit. 

Given more time, I would have added more info about the comic books, such as the creators and date published, and have given the user more ways to search and find comics.
